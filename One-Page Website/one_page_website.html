			<h1>P'dett</h1>
				<div>
					<p>
						<strong>P'dett of Razormarsh</strong> is a grung (a species of frog-like humanoid people) warrior. He is one of the characters that I play in Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition, and on this page I will introduce him to you.
					</p>
				</div>
				<br>
				<div>
					<p>
						P'dett is a 4th-level paladin who follows the Oath of Glory. In the Features &amp; Traits section below, you will find the various game features he has, whether granted by his class (paladin), species (grung), background (marine), or general feats. In the Gallery, you will find some images of what grung warriors can look like in D&amp;D, as well as a video guide on creating your own paladin character.

					<details class="background">
						<summary><h3>Background Features</h3></summary>
						<div>
							<h4>Hardship Endured</h4>
							<p>Hardship in your past has forged you into an unstoppable living weapon. This hardship is essential to you and is at the heart of a personal philosophy or ethos that often guides your actions.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div>
							<h4>Steady</h4>
							<p>You can move twice the normal amount of time (up to 16 hours) each day before being subject to the effect of a forced march (see "Travel Pace" in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook). Additionally, you can automatically find a safe route to land a boat on shore, provided such a route exists.</p>

						<summary><h3>Paladin Class Features</h3></summary>
						<div>
							<h4>Divine Sense</h4>
							<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the Hallow spell.</p>
							<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div>
							<h4>Lay On Hands</h4>
							<p>Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x5.</p>
							<p>As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one. This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div>
							<h4>Fighting Style</h4>
							<p><em>Dueling.</em> When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div>
							<h4>Divine Smite</h4>
							<p>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div>
							<h4>Divine Health</h4>
							<p>By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div>
							<h4>Sacred Oath</h4>
							<p><em>Glory. </em> Paladins who take the Oath of Glory believe they and their companions are destined to achieve glory through deeds of heroism. They train diligently and encourage their companions so they're all ready when destiny calls.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p><em>Oath Spells.</em> Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>
									<p>If you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><em>Channel Divinity.</em> Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.</p>
									<p>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>
									<p>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						
						<div>
							<h4>Tenets of Glory</h4>
							<p>The tenets of the Oath of Glory drive a paladin to attempt heroics that might one day shine in legend.</p>
							<p><em>Actions over Words.</em> Strive to be known by glorious deeds, not words.</p>
							<p><em>Challenges Are but Tests.</em> Face hardships with courage, and encourage your allies to face them with you.</p>
							<p><em>Hone the Body.</em> Like raw stone, your body must be worked so its potential can be realized.</p>
							<p><em>Discipline the Soul.</em> You must marshal the discipline to overcome failings within yourself that threaten to dim the glory of you and your friends.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div>
							<h4>Channel Divinity</h4>
							<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.</p>
							<p><em>Peerless Athlete.</em> As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to augment your athleticism. For the next 10 minutes, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks; you can carry, push, drag, and lift twice as much weight as normal; and the distance of your long and high jumps increases by 10 feet (this extra distance costs movement as normal).</p>
							<p><em>Inspiring Smite.</em> Immediately after you deal damage to a creature with your Divine Smite feature, you can use your Channel Divinity as a bonus action and distribute temporary hit points to creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you, which can include you. The total number of temporary hit points equals 2d8 + your level in this class, divided among the chosen creatures however you like.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div>
							<h4>Harness Divine Power</h4>
							<p>Also at 3rd level, you can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to fuel your spells. As a bonus action, you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). The number of times you can use this feature is based on the level you've reached in this class: 3rd level, once; 7th level, twice; and 15th level, thrice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
