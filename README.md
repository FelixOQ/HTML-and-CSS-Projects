# HTML and CSS Projects
## Introduction
This repository will contain my HTML and CSS projects for the Tech Academy web development course.

## Projects
Here are some of the sample websites I have made using HTML and CSS:
* [Celesta Aradora Character Overview](Website%20Project/index.html)
* [P'dett Character Overview](One-Page%20Website/one_page_website.html)
* [Movie Theatre Site](bootstrap4_project/academy_cinemas.html)

### Celesta Aradora Character Overview
This page is a basic overview of one of my Dungeons & Dragons characters, a wildfire druid name Celesta Aradora. It is styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.

### P'dett Character Overview
Another Dungeons & Dragons character, P'dett the grung paladin is introduced on this page. It utilises further CSS styling, video embedding, navbar, form, and Flexbox.

### Movie Theatre Site
This is an example homepage for a movie theatre which is styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many Bootstrap elements, including a navbar, jumbotron, form, and cards.
